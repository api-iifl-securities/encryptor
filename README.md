### Encryptor

The encryptor can help you encrypt your demat account credentials using your encryption key. The application is specifically built for IIFL Securities demat account customers who have generated API keys and want to encrypt the credentials to use in the login APIs.

The application doesn't store any of the credentials and built specifically to encrypt the parameters.

You can refer to the API documentation at https://api.iiflsecurities.com/.
